# cosmic-node-classification-gcn-vs-gat
This notebook explores node classification in a simulated celestial graph using PyTorch Geometric. It compares three models â€” MLP (baseline), GCN (message passing), and GAT (attention-based). Accuracy and embeddings are visualized to understand model differences.
